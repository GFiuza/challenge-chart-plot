This is a very simple implementation of the challenge, as i've never used reactJS.
For the input, I've managed to read a series of events, and plot them below the TextArea.

I created a single component (EventPlot), with the TextArea where the data is inputted, below is the Plot, that was made using Plotly lib, and finally is the footer with a button to generate the plot.

As I never used reactJS, I had some trouble implementing this challenge.

The component mentioned is documentaded with every decision i made.
